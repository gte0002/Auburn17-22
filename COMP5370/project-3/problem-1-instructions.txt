Problem 1 uses the python3 + pip method. It also uses the dpkt method. 
(dpkt folder is in the problem-1-src folder, I am unsure if it is needed or not)

There should be no having to build or do anything specific with the file (besides making sure dpkt is available)

To run the code simply do:

'python3 detector.py example-data.pcap'

where "example-data.pcap" was the file given and used for testing of this method, however, any .pcap file will work here.
(the example-data.pcap file is included in the problem-1-src folder in case it is needed for testing)
