TIMING-23#2 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between count_OBUF[1]_inst_i_1/I1 and count_OBUF[1]_inst_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#3 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between count_OBUF[2]_inst_i_1/I2 and count_OBUF[2]_inst_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-23#4 Warning
Combinational loop found  
A timing loop has been detected on a combinational path. A timing arc has been disabled between count_OBUF[3]_inst_i_1/I3 and count_OBUF[3]_inst_i_1/O to disable the timing loop
Related violations: <none>
