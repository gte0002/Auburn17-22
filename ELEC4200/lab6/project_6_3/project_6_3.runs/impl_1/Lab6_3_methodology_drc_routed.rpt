2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net clk_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): clk_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin Q_reg/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock UUT1/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin UUT1/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins
Related violations: <none>
