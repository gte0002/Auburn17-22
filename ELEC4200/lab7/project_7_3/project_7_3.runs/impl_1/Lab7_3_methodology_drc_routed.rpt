2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell state[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) state_reg[0]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell state_reg[2]_LDC_i_1, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous reset pin(s) state_reg[1]_P/PRE, state_reg[2]_P/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#1 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_green_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#2 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_green_reg[1]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#3 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_red_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#4 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin count_yellow_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#5 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin pedestrian_count_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#6 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[0]/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#7 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[1]_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#8 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[1]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#9 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[2]_C/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-17#10 Warning
Non-clocked sequential cell  
The clock pin state_reg[2]_P/C is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch state_reg[2]_LDC cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin state_reg[2]_LDC/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>
