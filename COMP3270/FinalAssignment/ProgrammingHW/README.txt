I used the JGRASP IDE to create, write, compile, debug, and run my code.

I certify that I wrote the code I am submitting. I did not copy whole or parts of it
from another student or have another person write the code for me. Any code I am reusing 
in my program is clearly marked as such with its source clearly identified in comments.


Included in this zipped file should be:

=> Source code with name: AlgorithmsHW.java and AlgorithmsHW.class
=> PDF file and Word doc containing my analysis with name: ProgrammingHW
